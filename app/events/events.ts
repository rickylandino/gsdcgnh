            <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">An AKC FIT DOG Club is a local group of dog owners who meet to work on fitness goals with their dogs. The American Kennel Club (AKC) launched the AKC FIT DOG program in 2018 to encourage people and their dogs to be more active together.</p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">To become an AKC FIT DOG Club, a group must:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                <li>Be an AKC club, independent dog training school, or other dog-related club or organization</li>
                <li>Complete the online FIT DOG Club Application</li>
                <li>Conduct at least four group fitness walks per year or regularly scheduled canine fitness classes</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">The goal of AKC FIT DOG clubs is to promote the health and fitness of dogs and their owners. Clubs host a variety of events, including: Community runs, Club walks, and FIT DOG classes.</p>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">The AKC FIT DOG program also offers a way for dog owners to earn titles for their dogs by completing structured activities. There are three levels of titles: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. To earn a title, dogs must earn points in at least six fitness categories, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AKC Course</li>
                <li>Community runs</li>
                <li>Walks and hikes</li>
                <li>Unique activities, such as parkour or swimming</li>
                <li>Fitness-related AKC Performance Titles, such as Agility, Diving Dogs, Fast CAT, or Obedience</li>
